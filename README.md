Renders a pygame window of a slowly crawling list

My spirit guide on this idea is NITELISTZ (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnNIqqTO9j8)

I'm imagining a rendered window on a black background, with a slowly upwards-crawling list of arbitrary data.
Then I can feed funny lists, maybe songs from the rhymadex, and have them crawl up the screen.
I can capture this window in VDMX and apply real-time video effects.

Currently prototying this out in pygame.
